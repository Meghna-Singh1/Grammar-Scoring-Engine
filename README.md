Audio Regression using ML
This project demonstrates how to perform audio-based regression using machine learning techniques. We extract meaningful features from .wav files using librosa, and then train regression models (Random Forest and XGBoost) to predict continuous values (e.g., scores, emotion intensity, etc.).

📁 Project Structure
train.csv – Metadata including filenames and labels (target variable).

test.csv – Metadata for test audio files (filenames only).

audios_train/ – Directory containing training audio samples.

audios_test/ – Directory containing test audio samples.

Manifestshl.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with all preprocessing, feature extraction, training, and evaluation code.

submission.csv – Final predictions generated by the trained model.

🔧 Libraries Used
numpy

pandas

librosa

matplotlib

scikit-learn

xgboost

tqdm

torch (optional)

📊 Workflow
Data Loading
Load CSV files and inspect training/testing metadata.

Preprocessing
Check for missing values and clean the data if necessary.

Visualization
Plot waveforms using librosa.display.

Feature Extraction
Extract MFCCs, Chroma, Spectral Contrast, Zero-Crossing Rate, RMS Energy using librosa.

Model Training

RandomForestRegressor

XGBRegressor

Model Evaluation
Evaluate models using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Pearson Correlation

Test Predictions
Extract features from test audio and generate final predictions.

📤 Output
submission.csv containing test filenames and predicted labels.
